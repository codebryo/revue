Revue
=====

# This Project is deprecated in favor of the official [vue-test-utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/en/)

Approachable testing for Vue Components.

## What's this?

`Revue` is a helper class that let's you access a Vue Component and provides a small API to interact with the reactive instance. Use it with the test system you like best.

## Installation

Install through `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
# with npm
$ npm install revue-testing

# with yarn
$ yarn add revue-testing
```

then you can require it in your file:

```js
const Revue = require('revue-testing')
```

and up we go...

## Getting Started

To get running with `Revue` you first need to instantiate it accordingly.

```js
const Component = {

  props: ['secret'],

  data() {
    return {
      msg: 'Hello Revue!'
    }
  }
  ... // your Vue component
}

let rv = new Revue(Component)
```

You can also pass various things into the Vue instance. Let's start by passing in custom information leveraging Vue's `propsData` option.
Assuming the component uses props it's easy as this:

```js
let rv = new Revue(Component, { props: { secret: 'Revue is awesome' }})
```

That's pretty convenient right? Well how about aiming high already and leverage a store? (Currently only [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/) is supported)

```js
const store = {
  state: {
    love: 1
  },

  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.love++
    }
  }
}

let rv = new Revue(Component, { store })
```

Now your component can work with the store as expected. For convenience a `$store` accessor is provided for you.

## The API

**The $ instance**

`$` let's you interact with the instance itself and get or set data as known.

```js
console.log(rv.$.msg) // 'Hello Revue!'
console.log(rv.$.secret) // 'Revue is awesome'

rv.$.msg = 'Interaction happening'

console.log(rv.$.msg) // 'Interaction happening!'
```

**$html**

This let's you get the current rendered markup of the instance as formatted HTML string. (Great for Snapshot testing)

*Caveats:* To stay pragmatic this is not solving the fact that Vue uses `nextTick` to reflect data changes on the markup.

```js
rv.$html // Returns formatted HTML String
```

**$tick**
If you need access to the HTML markup after some changes where applied the `$tick` function will be your friend. The passed callback function will allow to execute code after Vue's `nextTick` has been called.

```js
rv.$.msg = 'New content'
console.log(rv.$html) // Not updated

rv.$tick(() => {
    console.log(rv.$html) // Now updated content
})
```

**$store**
In case a store was injected into the component it can access through the `$tick` getter.

```js
rv.$store.state.love // 1

// The same as

rv.$.$store.state.love // 1
```

## WIP

- Extend API to allow interactions (click buttons, etc.)
- Allow injection of components
- Extend Documentation
- Example guide how to use with Jest
